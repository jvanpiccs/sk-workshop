    "As the Copilot concept evolves, it's important to think on ways to extend their capabilities, allowing them to retrieve external information, interact with external services and execute actions on the behavior of the user on a safer way, following Responsible AI principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **Plugins** is an answer to this, as they can act as a \"bridge\" between Copilots / AI Apps and the digital world. \n",
    "![Plugins Overview](images/plugins_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With Plugins, it's possible to expand Copilots capabilities and promote interoperability across the industry as Semantic Kernel adopts an open standard for plugins, the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with the creation of Functions, which will be the base of our AI Plugins. In Semantic Kernel we can think of Plugins as a collection of functions. Let's see in the following sections how we can create functions and group them together as a Plugin. "

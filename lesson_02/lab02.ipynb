    "#### What are AI Plugins?\n",
    "As the Copilot concept evolves, it's important to think on ways to extend their capabilities, allowing them to retrieve external information, interact with external services and execute actions on the behavior of the user on a safer way, following Responsible AI principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **Plugins** is an answer to this, as they can act as a \"bridge\" between Copilots / AI Apps and the digital world. \n",
    "![Plugins Overview](images/plugins_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With Plugins, it's possible to expand Copilots capabilities and promote interoperability across the industry as Semantic Kernel adopts an open standard for plugins, the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with the creation of Functions, which will be the base of our AI Plugins. In Semantic Kernel we can think of Plugins as a collection of functions. Let's see in the following sections how we can create functions and group them together as a Plugin. "

    "In the first lesson, we have created and used an [**inline**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins/semantic-functions/inline-semantic-functions?tabs=python) Semantic Function to categorize a call.However this approach is fine for development and testing, we need a more robust way to ensure we can reuse the functions across projects and rapidly maintain / change the prompts and function parameters as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we'll now explore how we can reuse such functions. Semantic Kernel allows us to import files to define functions. We must follow a standard folder structure when creating the files. Here's an example:\n",

Good morning, Peter.Before we begin, may I ask some questions to better answer your questions today, yes.In case we get disconnected, can you share your phone number and e-mail address so we can get in touch and share additional information?Yes, my phone number is 02199991234 and my e-mail address is peter.smith@contoso.com. May I ask where your business is located so I can answer your questions based on your location? Yes, my business is located in Dallas state of Texas.Thank you. How can I help you today? I am relatively new to this process and currently do everything manually.Do you have any advice or tips on manual telephone billing processing? If you are a small business with few employees and have opted for manual billing, you will need to keep accurate records of employees and devices among other details.You should also ensure that your calculations are correct and remember to submit all necessary proof on time.Thank you, that is quite helpful. Are there specific procedures I should follow?Certain aspects of billing processing are regulated by Anatel. Some of the rules you must comply with include resolution number 717 and the general telecommunications law. That sounds very complicated. I really don't feel like managing all of this. If you would like, I can transfer you to one of our specialized agents who can talk to you about billing service providers who will help you manage all of this.All right. Thank you very much for all your help.\n"

    "#### What are AI Plugins?\n",
    "As the Copilot concept evolves, it's important to think on ways to extend their capabilities, allowing them to retrieve external information, interact with external services and execute actions on the behavior of the user on a safer way, following Responsible AI principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **Plugins** is an answer to this, as they can act as a \"bridge\" between Copilots / AI Apps and the digital world. \n",
    "![Plugins Overview](images/plugins_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With Plugins, it's possible to expand Copilots capabilities and promote interoperability across the industry as Semantic Kernel adopts an open standard for plugins, the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with the creation of Functions, which will be the base of our AI Plugins. Here, we'll explore Plugins as a collection of functions. "

    "#### Creating and importing Semantic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lesson, we have created and used an [**inline**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins/semantic-functions/inline-semantic-functions?tabs=python) Semantic Function to categorize a call.However this approach is fine for development and testing, we need a more robust way to ensure we can reuse the functions across projects and rapidly maintain / change the prompts and function parameters as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we'll now explore how we can reuse such functions. Semantic Kernel allows us to import files to define functions. We must follow a standard folder structure when creating the files. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "📁 plugins\n",
    "│\n",
    "└─── 📂 plugin_name_A\n",
    "     |\n",
    "     └─── 📂 function_name_A \n",
    "     |      |\n",
    "     |      └───📄 skprompt.txt\n",
    "     |      └───📄 config.json\n",
    "     |\n",
    "     └─── 📂 function_name_B \n",
    "            |\n",
    "            └───📄 skprompt.txt\n",
    "            └───📄 config.json\n",
    "    📂 plugin_name_B\n",
    "     |\n",
    "     └─── 📂 function_name_C \n",
    "            |\n",
    "            └───📄 skprompt.txt\n",
    "            └───📄 config.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this structure in mind, we already start organizing our plugins and grouping together functions that belong to a plugin. For each Function (represented by a Folder) we must have two files:\n",
    "* **skprompt.txt**: it's the file that will contain the prompt of a Semantic Function. Therefore, we can easily maintain our functions by reviewing the prompts;\n",
    "* **config.json**: it's a configuration file that will describe the function in natural language, define which parameters the function requires, and the overall configuration the LLM should use run that function, such as temperature and maximum number of tokens. "
